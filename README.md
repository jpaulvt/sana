# Sana Case Study

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I took a snapshot of the index.html at sanabenefits.com and added a "Provider Lookup" link at the top of the menu which will render a Modal providing the NPI provider lookup functionality.

## Source Code

See the project src/ directory to see the js and css that were created for this demo.
The src/components directory contains the React components designed to implement the provider lookup.


## Demo
Given that the NPI registry service rejects cross origin requests, I needed
to use a CORS proxy to get the back end service working.

You will first need to click here to enable the CORS proxy temporarily:
https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com

Once the CORS proxy is enabled from your IP address, you can see a demo of the React application here: https://main.d3avjb7v6ksqr8.amplifyapp.com/

Click on the "Provider Lookup" top menu item (next to Log In) to pop up the modal that provides the NPI Provider Lookup.
Once the modal pops up, select a state and enter at least two character of the provider's first or last name.
No need to click a button to submit - automatically looks up the provider after user stops typing for 500 ms.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
